# Time Series Analysis programs
-	These programs enable you to explore a time series in more depth. When you run the programs you have the option to output:
	-	a spreadsheet containing various monthly statistics
	-	a set of plots showing daily totals for each month in the time series, arranged by water year, or
	-	both the spreadsheet and plots.

#Two variations of the program:

-	Analyse Time Series - Single WAP V2.py
	-	Once a valid WAP is entered the program will execute and will generate two files:
	-	An Excel spreadsheet containing monthly summary statistics
	-	A PDF file containing a collection of time series plots.

-	Analyse Time Series â€“ WAP List V1.py
	-	In this version of the program you can supply a list of WAPs (in a csv file) and the program will then iterate through those WAPs. NB: because the time series are so extensive for some WAPs, be wary of feeding the program a large list as plots are slow to generate.
