-	Quality Assessment - WAP List - Combined Series V1.py
	-	Hilltop sometimes contains multiple measures of water use for a single WAP. In order to produce the time series plots it’s necessary to stitch these different measures together while taking care to avoid overlaps. This program lets you perform a quality assessment on the ‘Combined Series’.

-	Quality Assessment – WAP List – By Measurement Type V1.py
	-	This variation produces a quality assessment for each type of water use measurement that a WAP has. For example, in the case of N34/0342-M1 which has three measurement types (Compliance Volume, Volume and Water Meter), a quality assessment is provided for each of the three data series. This may be useful for determining the best data to include – for each WAP – in a combined time series.
